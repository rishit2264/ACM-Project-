# ACM-Project-
This project implements a deep learning-based image classification model to distinguish between ripe and unripe tomatoes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
# Project-Overview-
Image preprocessing (resizing and scaling)
Training a CNN model with a fixed architecture.
Plotting the training and validation accuracy/loss to visualize the model performance.
Testing the model on new tomato images and saving the trained model.
